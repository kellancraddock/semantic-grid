A fork of the Semantic Grid system utalizing the box-sizing rule to normalize container widths. This would allow for padding and borders on the column element, ultimately reducing markup and/or required css rules.

Initial support for modern browsers, IE8+. Will attempt a graceful fallback for browsers that dont support the box-sizing rule.
